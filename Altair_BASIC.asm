;* On the Altair, the "sense switches" are used by BASIC to select the type of *
;* serial card and the the number of stop bits; in this case, an 88-2SIO card  *
;* at addresses 0x10 and 0x11 (octal 20 and 21) with 2 stop bits. These BASIC  *
;* images have been hacked to eliminate the requirement for sense switches.    *
;*                                                                             *
;* Configure Teraterm for 7 data bits, odd parity, 2 stop bits.                *
;* For the 8080 SBC use 115200 bps. For the 8085 SBC, use 19200 bps.           *

;* When using Teraterm's "Send File" function to send an Intel hex file or     *
;* BASIC source file to the Altair BASIC interpreter, set Teraterm's serial    *
;* port options for 1 msec/char and 50 msec/line transmit delay.               *
